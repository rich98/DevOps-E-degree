Password Genertator

Passgen.py

It imports the string and random modules.
It defines a function generate_password(length) that generates a random password of a given length. Hereâ€™s what happens inside this function:
It creates a string all_characters that contains all ASCII letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and punctuation symbols. This is done by concatenating string.ascii_letters, string.digits, and string.punctuation.

It then generates the password. This is done by choosing a random character from all_characters for the number of times specified by length. The random.choice() function is used to pick a random character, and this is done in a loop that runs length times. The chosen characters are joined together into a string using the join() method, and this string is the generated password.
Finally, it calls generate_password(22), which generates a 22-character password, and prints this password.
So, if you run this script, it will print out a randomly generated 12-character password. The password will contain a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. Each run will likely produce a different password because of the randomness. This can be useful for creating strong, hard-to-guess passwords.
If you want to adjust the length of the password cAN THE VALUE OF  generate_password(22) longer of shorter

PassgenCreate10.py

In this code, generate_multiple_passwords is a new function that generates a specified number of passwords, each of a specified length. It uses a list comprehension to call generate_password the specified number of times, and returns a list of the generated passwords. Then, it prints each password in the list. You can adjust the number of passwords and their length as needed.

It also proves that the passwords are being creted randomly
