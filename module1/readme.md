This script is a Bash script that performs a system backup with various features, including compression, encryption, and logging. Let's break down each step:

Set Variables:

compression: A flag indicating whether compression is enabled.
encryption_password: Password used for encryption.
password_file: Path to a file containing the encryption password.
backup_dirs: Array of directories to include in the backup.
exclude_dirs: Array of directories to exclude from the backup.
max_file_size: Maximum file size to exclude from the backup.
backup_dir: Destination directory for the system backup.
date_format: Date and time format for the backup folder and log files.
Mount Backup Folder:

Attempts to mount the backup folder /backup from the device /dev/sda1 with the ext4 filesystem type.
If the mount fails, an error message is logged, and the script exits.
Encryption Setup:

Creates a password file and sets its permissions.
Defines GPG encryption and verification commands.
Define Directories:

Lists directories to include (backup_dirs) and exclude (exclude_dirs) in the backup.
Create Backup Folder:

Creates a backup folder with a timestamp.
Define Log Files:

Sets up log files for rsync output, skipped files, and a hash file.
Start Backup:

Records the start time in the log file.
Rsync Commands:

Uses rsync to copy files from specified directories to the backup folder, excluding certain directories.
Logs output to the rsync log file.
If rsync fails for any directory, an error message is logged, and the script exits.
Filter Skipped Files:

Extracts and logs skipped files from the rsync log.
End Backup:

Records the end time in the log file.
Log File Statistics:

Retrieves and logs the number of files backed up and skipped.
Copy Log Files:

Copies hash and rsync log files to /usr/local/bin/backup_scripts/ for debugging.
Compression:

If compression is enabled, creates a tarball from the backup folder, compresses it, and removes the original folder.
Encryption:

Encrypts the compressed backup folder using GPG.
Hash Calculation:

Computes the SHA-256 hash of the encrypted system backup folder and logs it.
Cleanup:

Removes unnecessary files in the backup directory, leaving only the tarball and log files.
Remove Password File:

Removes the password file after completing the backup.
Unmount Backup Folder:

Unmounts the /backup folder.
The script is designed to provide a comprehensive backup solution with options for compression, encryption, and detailed logging. It handles various scenarios and includes measures to protect against ransomware by unmounting the backup folder during working hours
