This script is a backup script for a Linux system. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Set Variables**: It sets some variables at the beginning, such as whether to compress the backup (`compression=true`), the encryption password (`encryption_password="blackswan"`), and the directories to include and exclude in the backup.

2. **Mount Backup Folder**: It mounts the backup folder (`mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /backup`).

3. **GPG Encryption Settings**: It sets up GPG encryption settings with a password file. The password is written to a file (`password_file="/usr/local/bin/backup_script/password_file.txt"`), and the file permissions are set so that only the owner can read and write to it (`chmod 600 "$password_file"`).

4. **Rsync Command**: It uses the `rsync` command to copy each directory listed in the `backup_dirs` array to the backup folder. It excludes the directories listed in the `exclude_dirs` array and any files larger than the `max_file_size` (1 GB).

5. **Logging**: It logs the completion of the backup to a log file (`echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") Backup completed successfully" >> "$log_file"`).

6. **Compression**: If compression is enabled (`if [ "$compression" = true ]`), it compresses the backup folder into a tarball and removes the original backup folder.

7. **Encryption**: It encrypts the backup folder or tarball using the GPG command (`$gpg_command "$backup_folder"`).

8. **SHA-256 Hash**: It computes the SHA-256 hash of the encrypted tarball and saves it to a file (`sha256sum "$backup_folder.gpg" > "$hash_file"`).

9. **Cleanup**: It removes all files in the backup directory except for the tarball and the log file (`find "$backup_dir" -type f ! -name "$(basename "$backup_folder.gpg")" ! -name "$(basename "$log_file")" -delete`), and it removes the password file after the backup (`rm -f "$password_file"`).

10. **Unmount Backup Folder**: Finally, it unmounts the backup folder (`umount -f /backup`).

This script is designed to create a secure, encrypted backup of important system directories, while excluding certain directories and large files. It logs its progress, and it cleans up after itself by removing the password file and any extraneous files in the backup directory. It's a good example of a comprehensive backup script for a Linux system. 
This script is designed to restore a backup of a Linux system that was previously saved and encrypted. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:


Restoring files

Useage

./restore.sh /restore

This script is a restore script for a Linux system. Here’s a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Set Decryption Password**: It sets the decryption password that will be used to decrypt the backup files (decryption_password="blackswan").

2. **GPG Decryption Settings**: It sets up GPG decryption settings with a password file. The password is written to a file (password_file="/usr/local/bin/restore_script/password_file.txt"), and the file permissions are set so that only the owner can read and write to it (chmod 600 "$password_file").

3. **GPG Command for Decryption**: It sets up the GPG command for decryption (gpg_command="gpg --decrypt --batch --passphrase-file $password_file").

4. **List of Backup Files**: It creates a list of backup files to be restored (backup_files=("/backup/system_backup_*.tar.gz.gpg")).

5. **Decrypt and Extract** Each Backup File: For each backup file in the list, it decrypts the file and extracts its contents. If a destination directory is specified when the script is run, it will restore the backup to that location. If no destination is specified, it will restore the backup to its original location (/).

6. **Cleanup**: After the backup has been restored, it removes the decrypted file and the password file. This is done to maintain the security of the system and to ensure that no unnecessary files are left behind.

This script is designed to decrypt and extract the backup files to a specified directory or their original location. It cleans up after itself by removing the decrypted files and the password file. It’s a good example of a comprehensive restore script for a Linux system. 

Cron Job

See cron.png

30 12 * * Sun: This specifies the schedule of the cron job. It will run at 12:30 PM every Sunday.
/usr/local/bin/backup_script/backup.sh: This is the command that the cron job will execute. It appears to be a shell script for backing up data.
So, this cron job will execute the backup.sh script located in /usr/local/bin/backup_script/ every Sunday at 12:30 PM
